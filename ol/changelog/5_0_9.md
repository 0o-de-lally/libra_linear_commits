## 5.0.9

Very minor changes to the config creator for the VFN configurations (vfn.node.yaml). The ID of the VFN needs to be permanent once shared in on-chain discovery info.

This includes `txs` tooling for updating on-chain info, plus helpers to print what configs currently exist.

#### TL;DR Deployment

Update binaries to use patches.

```

# install new binaries
cd ~/libra
git fetch
git checkout v5.0.9 -f
make bins install

```

Recreate your VFN configs, and deploy on VFN.

```
# On your validator (or wherever your key_store.json lives)
# create settings for the VFN, private fullnode
ol init --vfn

# now copy the vfn.node.yaml file to your fullnode
```

Check and update your on-chain configuration

### Summary

This upgrade corrects behavior of vfn.node.yaml config creator, and provides tooling for updating on-chain node discovery information (update IP addresses).

### Changes

##### Move Changes
None

##### Rust Changes
##### - Changes to default settings for nodes, and tools to generate files.

Many (breaking) changes to ol cli - `init`. 
It can now:
- generate the inital 0L.toml with --app.
- create the initial `key_store.json` with --key-store.
- generate a number of node.yaml files: --val, --vfn, --fullnode.
- --seed-peers will fetch the validator fullnodes from chain, and save to file.
- --update-waypoint will fetch from chain to replace base_waypoint in 0L.toml file.

Deprecated:
- `--checkup` and `--fix` are no longer implemented given breaking changes. Perhaps TBD.

Changes to `config/management/genesis/ol_node_files.rs` so that the val, vfn, and fullnode configs can be atomically generated. And refactors throughout to use correct keys and settings. Also ability for node files to include a `seed_peers.yaml` (which can be fetched with `ol init` from chain) to configure files.

Minor change to `onboard kegen` so that `--whoami` will print the different public keys the node depends on.

Global constants are updates, so that there are consistent ports used for fullnode and vfn.

`config/management/genesis/seeds` has changes so that seed peers can be read from file.

Changes to defaults:
mempool: `capacity_per_user` a user can only have 3 txs in the mempool at a given time.
network configs: PING_FAILURES_TOLERATED increased to 10K, MAX_FULLNODE_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS incresed from 10 to 100. Hypothetically fixing the "split brain" issues in the December outage.
state-sync: increase the `tick_interval_ms` from 100ms to 1sec.

Patches a bug with `ol` subcommands panicking due to bad unwraps: https://github.com/OLSF/libra/issues/903

##### Tests

- All continuous integration tests passed.
- The diem-code was tested on a "Canary rollout" to three production nodes that were both synced and out of sync.

##### Compatibility
The Move framework changes are backwards compatible with `diem-node` from v5.0.1

### Rust changes
#### Diem Node
Changes to `diem-node` is compatible with on-chain state from `v5.0.5`.
