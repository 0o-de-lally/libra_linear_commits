## 5.1.0

This minor upgrade includes improvments to tooling, updates to default node configurations.

### TL;DR Deployment

The Stdlib (Move changes), were already issued on a halted network.

There are minimal bugfixes to Tower, added transaction types to Txs, and new data presented in web-monitor.

Validators should update with:

```
cd ~/libra
git fetch
git checkout v5.1.0 -f
make bins install web-files

# you can now restart your services
```
