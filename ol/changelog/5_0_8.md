## 5.0.8

Changes tools to create config files, and a small change to `diem-node` to accept a minor change to node.yaml structure.

#### TL;DR

Update binaries to use patches.

```

# install new binaries
cd ~/libra
git fetch
git checkout v5.0.8 -f
make bins install


```

Recreate network configs
```
# backup validator config
mv ~/.0L/validator.node.yaml ~/.0L/validator.node.yaml.bak_20221204

# create the new validator yaml. This will overwrite previous.
ol config --val

# create settings for the VFN, private fullnode
ol config --vfn

# next, copy the ~/.0L/vfn.node.yaml to the host machine of the fullnode.

<stop diem-node>
<restart diem-node>

```

### Summary

The goal of this upgrade is to get all validators on the same node configurations so that mempool, connection attempts, and fullnode network configurations optimize for the network maintaining a full mesh.

The changes are primarily to tooling which generate keys and configurations for the private fullnode used by validators (VFN).

These changes do not affect Move code (no changes to system state or policies). It only upgrades `diem-node`. There is a minor change to diem-node so that it can use the NodeConfig object which now contains the version number which generated the file.

### Changes

##### Move Changes
None

##### Rust Changes
##### - Changes to default settings for nodes, and tools to generate files.




##### Tests

- All continuous integration tests passed.
- The diem-code was tested on a "Canary rollout" to three production nodes that were both synced and out of sync.

##### Compatibility
The Move framework changes are backwards compatible with `diem-node` from v5.0.1

### Rust changes
#### Diem Node
Changes to `diem-node` is compatible with on-chain state from `v5.0.5`.
